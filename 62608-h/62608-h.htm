other animals, and the removal of these offers a
practical means of permanent rat control. The number
of rats on premises and the extent of their destructiveness
are usually in direct proportion to the
available food supply and to the shelter afforded.
Rat proofing in the broadest sense embraces not only
the exclusion of rats from buildings of all types but
also the elimination of their hiding and nesting places
and cutting off their food supply. Through open
doors and in other ways, rats may frequently gain
access to structures that are otherwise rat proof, but
they can not persist there unless they find safe retreats
and food. When rat proofing becomes the
regular practice the rat problem will have been
largely solved.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">T</span>HE PRINCIPLES of modern construction of buildings are
opposed to everything conducive to the best interests of the rat.
They call for the liberal use of indestructible and noncombustible
materials, as well-made concrete and steel, and these are too much for
even the sharpest of rodent incisors. They include, also, fire stopping
in double walls and floors and the elimination of all dead spaces and
dark corners, and the rat is left no place in which to hide. They
embody sanitary features that provide for hygienic storage of food,
and the rat can not live without something to eat.</p>

<p>Many men have devoted their lives to a study of methods of rat
control, and as a result countless preparations, devices, and contrivances
are constantly being made available. Trapping, snaring,
trailing, flooding, digging, hunting, ferreting, poisoning, and fumigating
are employed, and rat limes, rat lures, rat repellents, and bacterial
viruses are resorted to, and even antirat laws, local. State, and
national, are constantly being passed in a world-wide effort to conquer
this rodent. These have been important factors in keeping
down the surplus, but all destructive agencies that have been used
have utterly failed to reduce materially the total number of rats in
the world. Rat proofing, however, is at last making definite headway
against the age-old enemy of mankind, and it is upon this that
the ultimate solution of the rat problem will depend.</p>

<p>The destruction of rats for temporary relief and for keeping them
under control in places where rat proofing is not possible or practicable
will always be necessary, and knowledge of the best means of
destroying rats is essential to any rat-control program. Information
on poisoning, trapping, and other means of destroying rats is given
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">« 2 »</a></span>
in Farmers' Bulletin 1533, Rat Control. Permanent freedom from
rats, however, should be the goal of everyone troubled with the pests
and rat proofing offers the best means to this end.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="GENERAL_PRINCIPLES_OF_RAT_PROOFING" id="GENERAL_PRINCIPLES_OF_RAT_PROOFING">GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF RAT PROOFING</a></h2>


<p>Every separate structure presents its individual problem, but
there are two general principles that apply in all cases and that
should be kept in mind when the rat proofing of any building is
being considered. First, the exterior of those parts of the structure
accessible to rats, including porches or other appurtenances, must
be constructed of materials resistant to the gnawing of rats, and
all openings must be either permanently closed or protected with
doors, gratings, or screens; second, the interior of the building must
provide no dead spaces, such as double walls, spaces between ceilings
and floors, staircases, and boxed-in piping, or any other places
where a rat might find safe harborage, unless they are permanently
sealed with impervious materials.</p>

<p>All new buildings should be made rat proof. When plans are
being drawn for a building, the rat problem is frequently overlooked,
usually because rats are not often present near sites selected
for new structures. They are certain to come later, however, and
should therefore be taken into account. Modern structures are so
nearly rat proof that to make them completely so requires only slight
and inexpensive changes. Furthermore, rat proofing is closely associated
with fire stopping and with sanitary measures that are now
required by law in many places. Cities in growing numbers have
added rat proofing clauses to their building ordinances with such
good effect that others are sure to follow their lead. Builders should
therefore compare the cost of rat proofing during construction with
the probable later cost, in case local laws should require that all
buildings be made rat proof.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="RAT_PROOFING_FARM_BUILDINGS" id="RAT_PROOFING_FARM_BUILDINGS">RAT PROOFING FARM BUILDINGS</a></h2>


<p>The cost of rat proofing the entire premises of many American
farms would amount to less than the loss occasioned by rats on the
same farms during a single year. In no other place is rat proofing
more badly needed or less often accomplished than on the farm. There
are, however, numerous examples of rat-proof farms in nearly every
county in the United States, and almost invariably they are the
more prosperous farms, for the rat proofing of a farm is an indication
that the farmer has learned the necessity of stopping all small
leaks, which mean reduced profits.</p>

<p>A rat-proof farm is not necessarily one in which the entire farmstead
is absolutely proofed, but rather one where conditions are so
unfavorable for any invading rats that they either will desert the
premises of their own accord or may be easily routed by man or
dogs. The source of the trouble on almost any heavily rat-infested
farm can be traced directly to conditions that furnish rats safe
refuges near abundant food. The commoner of these rat-breeding
places are beneath wooden floors set a few inches off the ground in
poultry houses, barns, stables, granaries, corncribs, and even residences;
in piles of fuel wood, lumber, and refuse; in straw, hay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">« 3 »</a></span>,
and manure piles that remain undisturbed for long periods beneath
concrete floors without curtain walls; and inside double walls
of buildings. In rat proofing the farmstead as a whole, attention
should first be paid to the premises outside the buildings and later
to each building separately.</p>

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 1.</span>&mdash;An automatic garbage can, always closed</div>
</div>

<p>Neatness is of prime importance in keeping a place free from, rats,
and providing facilities for keeping it neat should be considered part
of the rat-proofing program. An incinerator, which can be made
from a discarded metal drum or rolled-up poultry netting, is convenient
for burning all trash and combustible waste; and a deep,
covered pit with a trapdoor will take care of tin cans and other
noncombustibles, if it is not practicable to haul them away at regular
intervals. A covered
garbage can is also indispensable on farms where
table scraps are not fed directly to poultry or hogs.
(<a href="#fig_1">Fig. 1.</a>) Raised platforms, 18 or more inches
high, should be provided
upon which to pile lumber
or other materials that if
placed on the ground
would afford shelter for
rats. (<a href="#fig_2">Fig. 2.</a>)</p>

<p>Large piles of cut stove
wood on many northern
farms become rat infested.
The same is true of manure
piles adjoining barns and,
to a lesser extent, of hay
and straw stacks near farm
buildings. These do not
provide food and are attractive
to rats for harbors
only if near a source
of food supply; moving
them to a place at some
distance from where foodstuffs
are handled will usually
solve the problem.</p>

<p>Stone walls at times furnish excellent harborage for rats but,
like the woodpile, only if there is ample food near by. Stone walls
supporting embankments and driveways on sloping farmsteads are
most frequently infested, and when this occurs the inviting openings
can usually be readily closed with small stones and cement.</p>

<p>Ditch banks often are a source of rat infestation, but in most
climates during the warmer months only. The rodents concentrate
in such places because they are less likely to be disturbed there.
Rat proofing the ditch bank consists merely of burning or otherwise
destroying the protective vegetation. This, of course, affords only
temporary relief and should not be considered strictly rat proofing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">« 4 »</a></span></p>

<p>The use of concrete in the construction of most farm buildings is
usually the best means of permanently excluding the rat. Fortunately,
many of the fundamentals of rat proofing are also principles
of good construction. As am example, in order to support a building
properly, the foundation should extend well into the ground
below the frost line; rat proofing likewise requires that the foundation
wall extend at least 2 feet below the surface. Rats seldom burrow
deeper than 2 feet unless natural passageways assist. Foundation
walls should project a foot or more above the ground in order
to protect the wooden parts of the building, and this also lessens the
opportunity for rats to gnaw through the wall. A rat is not likely
to cling to the exposed exterior of a building a foot above the ground
while it gnaws a hole through wooden sheathing or siding. It would
do so very quickly, however, if such siding extended to the ground,
where its work could be under cover of vegetation or behind some
object, particularly when the siding becomes somewhat rotted, as
would soon happen were it close to the ground.</p>

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 2.</span>&mdash;Lumber and other stored materials piled well off the ground to prevent
rat harborage</div>
</div>

<p>It is important that concrete be hard, as weak concrete is but a
slight obstacle to the sharp rodent incisors. The mixture approved
for ordinary building construction, however, is sufficiently hard to be
entirely rat proof, and it is essential that approved practices of
mixing and placing concrete be followed. Directions for using concrete
and for building concrete floors are given in Farmers' Bulletin
1279, Plain Concrete for Farm Use, and in Farmers' Bulletin 1480,
Small Concrete Construction on the Farm. Other approved building
practices, such as fire stopping double walls, eliminating waste
dead spaces, making doors, windows, and ventilators fit tightly, and
screening or permanently stopping all openings, are also necessary
in rat proofing. For simple farm buildings the foundation illustrated
in <a href="#fig_3">Figure 3</a> meets all the requirements of good construction
and will keep the rats out if the walls are tight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">« 5 »</a></span></p>

<p class="caption3"><a id="BARNS"></a>BARNS</p>

<p>It is seldom possible to shut out rats completely from barns or
entirely to cut off their food supply where livestock is fed. Little
trouble will be experienced with them, however, if their harbors are
eliminated. In barns rat harbors are most frequently found around
stalls, under wooden mangers, and stall partitions, and beneath
wooden or dirt floors. In modern barns with concrete floors, concrete
or metal mangers, and metal stanchions, such places of retreat
are entirely eliminated. In older barns it is desirable at least to
replace wooden and dirt floors with concrete and reconstruct the
mangers so that they are a foot or more
off the ground.</p>

<div class="fig_right" style="width: 169px;">

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 3.</span>&mdash;Foundation and
floor suitable for most types
of farm buildings</div>
</div>

<p>Another common source of rat trouble,
particularly in the northern half of the
United States, is the hollow wall, within
which rats find safe retreat and convenient
runways leading to the haymow. In recent
years fibrous insulating materials
have been used to line the interiors of
many farm buildings, and in most cases
these have resulted in greatly increased
rat infestation. Rats cut through these
composition boards very easily and seem
to be attracted by the facilities for breeding
thus provided. Hollow walls of any
kind accessible to rats should either be
eliminated or adequately rat proofed.
Such rat proofing may be accomplished
by filling the hollow spaces to a height of
8 or 10 inches above the sill with cement,
bricks, or other material resistant to the
gnawing of rats, or a strip of galvanized
metal 2 or more feet wide may be carried
around the inside wall just above the sill.</p>

<p>Old barns with wooden floors supported
a few inches above the ground on girders
and posts are particularly objectionable
from the standpoint of rat infestation and
should be rat proofed with concrete.
(<a href="#fig_4">Fig. 4.</a>) A concrete foundation wall extending
at least 2 feet below grade is placed under the girder between
the posts. The wooden posts may be removed after the wall has hardened,
and the spaces left should then be filled in with concrete. A
concrete floor is laid, and cement stucco on metal lath is extended up
the walls for at least 2 feet, preferably to the level of window sills.</p>

<p>Rock foundations in many old barns offer excellent harborage for
rats unless pointed carefully with cement mortar. If possible, the
floor should be raised to the level of the sill and the walls plastered
to the window-sill level (<a href="#fig_5">fig. 5</a>) in such manner as to prevent access
by rats to spaces between the studs.</p>

<p>The grain bin and other similar fixtures must always be considered
in rat proofing a barn. It is most important that they be so situated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">« 6 »</a></span>
or constructed that there shall be no hiding places for rats behind or
under them. The grain bin should be completely lined or covered
with metal and should have metal-clad lids. Any open spaces behind
or under the bins should be tightly closed with metal. (<a href="#fig_6">Fig. 6.</a>)</p>

</div>

<p>Other accessories of various kinds of barns should be examined
carefully and remodeled or moved if necessary to exclude rats or
eliminate harbors. The haymow frequently presents a difficult
problem in a heavily infested barn, but the haymow alone is seldom
responsible for the rats, for if all other rat harbors in the barn are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">« 7 »</a></span>
effectively eliminated or shut off,
the rats will not long remain with
the hay as their only shelter. If
the lower walls are of rough surface
or composed of open studs
covered on the outside, rats can
climb at the corners. They may
be prevented from doing so by the
application of a strip of metal 8
inches wide placed just below the
joists of the upper floor. Recommended
construction of walls
and floors in new frame barns is
shown in <a href="#fig_7">Figure 7</a>.</p>

<p class="caption3"><a id="CORNCRIBS"></a>CORNCRIBS</p>

<p>Of all the buildings on the average
farm the corncrib is usually
in greatest need of rat proofing.
Losses sometimes amounting to a
fourth or a third of the total quantity
of corn held over winter have
been known. A survey in a southern State showed an average loss
of 5 per cent of corn in storage; in one case 500 bushels were
destroyed in one crib during one winter.
The amount of this loss would
have been sufficient to pay for rat
proofing the crib several times over.
In building or remodeling a corncrib;
therefore, it is most important that
it be made permanently rat proof.
Probably the most satisfactory method
of accomplishing this with the common
slat-sided corncrib is entirely to
cover the walls and ceiling on the

its durability.</p>

<p class="caption3"><a id="GRANARIES"></a>GRANARIES</p>

<p>The rat proofing of granaries is of great importance, because of
the abundance of food stored there and the corresponding opportunity
for serious loss. The granary with concrete foundation and
floors, tight-fitting doors, and screened ventilators presents no unusual
problem, except possibly in connection with the elevator pit,
which should be carefully checked against possible means of ingress
for rats. Small wooden and portable granaries should be protected
with wire netting. (<a href="#fig_10">Fig. 10.</a>)</p>

<p>Concrete feeding floors, troughs (<a href="#fig_11">fig. 11</a>), water tanks, hog wallows,

(<a href="#fig_12">fig. 12</a>) to keep the rats

<p>It is not practicable to
attempt to exclude rats
from poultry houses, but
such buildings can easily
be made proof against
serious trouble by the elimination
of all places where
the rodents can obtain safe
harborage. Most rat infestation
around poultry
plants is due to the presence
of numerous shelters
and suitable breeding
places. Three things are
particularly to be avoided: Wooden floors on or within a few inches
of the ground; double walls; and nest boxes, feed hoppers, and
other fixtures placed so as to provide shelter for rats under or
behind them. From a rat-proofing standpoint the floors as well as
the foundation should be made of concrete. (<a href="#fig_13">Fig. 13.</a>) If this
is not considered practicable, wooden floors should be elevated so
as to insure a clear space of 2 or more feet between the floor and
the ground. Warmth can be provided, if necessary, by two thicknesses
of flooring with tar paper between. Hollow walls almost invariably
furnish harborage for rats. The inner stud covering therefore,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">« 10 »</a></span>
should be torn out, but if warmth is a factor to be considered,
siding should be put over sheathing on the outside of the studs with

<p>Portable laying and brooder houses frequently become heavily
infested because they are usually built with wooden floors removed
from the ground only by the height of
the runners on which they are constructed
and are seldom moved as frequently as
originally intended. Feed, sifting through
the floors, attracts rats, which after finding
desirable shelter soon establish themselves
in burrows beneath the houses and
multiply rapidly. Portable houses, therefore,
should be raised off the ground 2 or
more feet.</p>

<p>Nests should be raised 2 or more feet
above the floor, and feed and grit hoppers
at least 1 foot. Drinking vessels for water
and skim milk should supported on a
platform 1 to 1&frac12; feet above the floor, so as
to eliminate the possibility of rat shelters
and keep the liquids in a more sanitary condition.
Other equipment should be given
the same consideration.</p>

<p>The premises around the poultry house should be cleared of all
rat harbors by elevating all objects under which a rat can find
shelter. (<a href="#fig_14">Fig. 14.</a>) Near-by buildings particularly should be considered,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">« 11 »</a></span>
for it is frequently found that rats living exclusively on
poultry feed occupy harbors 50 or more feet away from the food
source. For this, reason it is desirable to build poultry plants at
least 100 feet from any possible rat harborage. The vast number
of young chicks killed annually by rats would be greatly reduced
if these simple precautions were taken.</p>

<p>There are many farm buildings of various kinds that should be

of the general principles of rat proofing, as previously explained,
will suffice. Not only should all buildings in which food is kept be
made inaccessible to rats, but adjoining and near-by buildings and
premises as well. The procedure to be followed in the case of farm
dwellings is omitted here, as sufficient is included under the next
heading, Rat Proofing City Buildings, the conditions with respect
to dwellings on farms and in towns being quite similar.</p>

<p>Outside cellars frequently become infested with rats, and great
havoc to stored produce almost invariably results. Considerable
expense, if necessary, is justified in making the storage cellar rat
proof. A cellarway with wooden steps and sills and earth floor is
usually the source of the trouble. The sill soon rots or the rats
burrow under it to gain entrance. The remedy is to construct a
concrete floor and cellarway. This not only will exclude rats but
will prove more economical in the long run. (<a href="#fig_15">Fig. 15.</a>)</p>

<h2><a name="RAT_PROOFING_CITY_BUILDINGS" id="RAT_PROOFING_CITY_BUILDINGS">RAT PROOFING CITY BUILDINGS</a></h2>


<p>In rat proofing a city building it is well first to look to the exterior.
If the locality is heavily infested with rats, some are almost certain
sooner or later to find their way into the building however well
protected against them it may be. Garbage and trash usually comprise
the bulk of the rats' food supply. A metal, water-tight garbage
can, large enough to contain all garbage accumulations between
collections and having a close-fitting lid (fig 1), is of prime importance
and should be required in all cases by city law.</p>

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 16.</span>&mdash;An accumulation of trash such as this Is almost certain to attract rats
and should be prohibited by law</div>
</div>

<p>Large accumulations of trash usually, contain much waste food
(<a href="#fig_16">fig. 16</a>) and are certain to attract rats and furnish an ideal breeding
place for them. Furthermore, they are a menace to health and
should not be tolerated under any circumstances. All other rat harbors,
such as wooden floors and sidewalks very near the ground,
should be removed or replaced with concrete, and piles of lumber
and various materials stored out of doors should be removed or elevated
18 or more inches. Particular care should be taken to see that
sheds and other outbuildings, porches, steps, loading platforms, and
similar structures on the premises are made rat proof, either by the
use of concrete, by elevation, or by keeping them open to the light
and easily accessible.</p>

<p>A thorough inspection should next be made of the building itself
and careful note taken of alterations and repairs necessary for a
thorough job of rat proofing. Inspection should begin in the basement.
Doors and windows should fit snugly, particularly doors
leading to outside stairs or elevators, and these should also be provided
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">« 14 »</a></span>
with automatic closing devices. Windows and ventilators
should be screened or covered with gratings, the openings not more
than half an inch square. Defects in basement floors should be repaired
with concrete, and floor drains should be fitted with tight
covers, (<a href="#fig_17">Fig. 17.</a>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">« 16 »</a></span></p>

<p>Basement ceilings, when accessible to rats, cause much trouble, and
frequently the best remedy is to remove them entirely. In frame
construction spaces between studs in walls opening into basements
also are a common cause of rat infestation of the whole building.
The permanent closing of these spaces with noncombustible material
not only shuts out the rats but also reduces the fire hazard by stopping
the drafts and the rising of heated gases should a fire start in
the basement. This process of blocking spaces between studs and
furring is commonly known as fire stopping and is of such importance
that the building regulations of many cities now require it.
<a href="#fig_20">Figure 20</a> illustrates practical methods of rat proofing stud spaces
in old buildings.</p>

</div>

<p>All openings between floors and in partitions made for the passage
of pipes and wires and any defects in the wall should be closed with
metal flashing. All dead spaces throughout the building, such as
boxed-in plumbing, spaces behind or beneath built-in cabinets,
counters, shelving, bins, show windows, and many similar places,
should be removed, opened up, or effectively and permanently
proofed against rats.</p>

<p>In the Southern States, where the roof rat occurs, similar care
must be taken to make the upper floors and roofs of buildings rat
proof, as this rat is an expert climber and frequently enters buildings
by way of the roof. Doors at the top of stairs and elevators should
fit snugly, and all ventilators, exhaust fans, unused chimney flues,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">« 17 »</a></span>
and other openings should be screened. Broken skylights and openings
under eaves and places where electric wires enter the building
should be repaired or closed.</p>

</div>

<p>Buildings that have neither basements nor continuous masonry
foundations present more difficult rat-proofing problems. The most
effective procedure is to construct a concrete foundation wall between
the existing supports and, after the wall has hardened, remove the
supports, if of wood, and replace them with concrete to make the
wall continuous. Where the cost prohibits following this plan and
where the supporting sill and joists are at least 2 feet above the
ground level, satisfactory rat proofing may be attained by stopping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">« 18 »</a></span>
the spaces between the studs with weak concrete or other material
resistant to rats for a distance of 8 inches above the floor level, or
with galvanized-metal flashing nailed to the joists, plate, and floor.
(<a href="#fig_21">Fig. 21.</a>) The space beneath the building must be free from all
rubbish and other material that would afford shelter for rats. A
continuous masonry foundation, with screened openings to provide
ventilation, presents a more pleasing appearance.</p>

<p>If the clearance between the ground level
and the bottom of girders and joists is less
than 2 feet, it may provide a hazardous rat
harbor. One of three things should be
done: The building should be elevated on
piers 2 feet above the ground; a concrete
foundation should be built as described
above; or a continuous concrete curtain
wall should be constructed under the entire
outer wall of the building. (<a href="#fig_22">Fig. 22.</a>)</p>

<p>Most new city buildings are now built
practically rat proof, or could be made so
with only minor changes in the plans and
at small cost. Yet if certain essential details
are not included at the start, endless
rat troubles are likely to ensue. It is
therefore highly desirable that plans for
every new building include specifications
for rat proofing.</p>

<p>All new buildings in which foodstuffs
are to be handled should have ground floors
of concrete or other rat-proof material
and concrete or masonry walls extending
at least 2 feet below and 1 foot above the
ground surface. All unnecessary openings
in the foundation, walls, and floors should
be permanently closed, and windows and
ventilators should be screened. Stud
spaces in frame construction should be
stopped with noncombustible material resistant
to rats. New buildings in which
foodstuffs are not to be handled may, if
desired, be elevated on piers or posts to
provide a clearance of 2 feet between the
ground level and the bottom of the supporting girders, although the
concrete or masonry wall is more satisfactory.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="MARKETS"></a>MARKETS</p>

<p>Public, farmers', and wholesale markets, commission houses, and
similar places where vast quantities of foodstuffs are assembled and
redistributed are nearly always infested with large numbers of
rats. Such structures are usually concentrated in districts, and
these often become rat-breeding centers, from which the rats constantly
overflow to adjoining sections of the city. Rat proofing a
district of this kind would seem to be almost hopeless, yet it has
often been demonstrated that the task is not only feasible but entirely
practicable. . Here, more than anywhere else, the great need is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">« 19 »</a></span>
elimination of rat shelters, which in turn means the free use of concrete
or other masonry. Scrupulous cleanliness is essential in markets,
but even where this is practiced it is not possible completely
to eliminate rat food, so the main reliance must be placed on the
removal of all rat harbors. Not only must the building in which
the market is housed be rat proofed, but also all the fixtures. In
old public markets the stalls were frequently constructed as if designed
for the protection of rats. Dark, out-of-the-way holes under
counters, stands, and shelves afford convenient places for the accumulation
of trash, which it would be well to destroy; and in such
locations, with abundance of food at hand, rats are in the best
possible position to thrive and multiply. The use of smooth concrete
or tile counters (<a href="#fig_23">fig. 23</a>) erected on concrete floors deprive
rats of the essential shelter, provided that the space underneath the
counter is kept clean and that stored material is moved frequently.
The smooth surface also prevents the rats from climbing and makes
it possible to leave edible products on the counter overnight without
fear of their being damaged or contaminated by the rodents. If
wooden floors are used, the boards should be laid flat on the concrete
or on sleepers not more than half an inch high.</p>

<p class="caption3"><a id="WAREHOUSES"></a>WAREHOUSES</p>

<p>Warehouses require rat proofing because of the great quantities
of foodstuffs handled there and even stored for long periods. It is
essential that the building itself be rat proofed with concrete or
masonry foundation, concrete floors, and tight-fitting doors lined
with metal at the base. Doors of warehouses frequently become
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">« 20 »</a></span>
jammed as a result of heavy trucking and should be carefully
watched for defects that would admit rats. Concrete floors, in addition
to being rat proof and fire proof, save labor because of the
comparative ease with which loaded trucks can be rolled over them.</p>

<p>When warehouses are found to be seriously infested with rats, the
trouble can usually be traced to such faulty construction as allows
the rats access to spaces beneath floors or within walls, or even provides
exits to near-by shelter outside.</p>

<p>Eats also gain entrance to rat-proofed warehouses through being
shipped in with produce or when doors are left open, and once
inside they may persist and do much damage from shelter afforded
by piles of stored goods. Such damage, however, is usually small
in comparison with that resulting from permanent rat harbors beneath
floors, and the rats can be destroyed much more easily. A
report from one flour warehouse indicated that it cost more than
$3,000 a year to repair bags gnawed by rats and mice. Such a loss
would go far toward rat proofing any premises. A common cause
of rat depredations in warehouses is the construction of platforms
a few inches off the floor upon which to pile flour and other produce.
Such platforms provide permanent shelter for rats and should be
eliminated. Boards may be laid flat on the concrete floor with no
spaces between them to afford rat harbors; or, if this is not sufficient
proof against dampness, the platforms should be raised a foot or
more off the floor to admit light. In such a place a rat does not
feel safe and will not stay. Bags of flour, grain, and other produce
furnish harborage that can not well be avoided, but such goods are
usually moved so frequently that rats do not have opportunity to</p>

<h2><a name="RAT_PROOFING_THE_CITY" id="RAT_PROOFING_THE_CITY">RAT PROOFING THE CITY</a></h2>


<p>Rat proofing the city is a responsibility of the city government.
The greatest force that can be exerted to-day toward the permanent
suppression of the rat pest is through the passage of practical building
ordinances that require the rat proofing of buildings and the
adoption of sanitary regulations that will insure clean premises and
adequate collection and disposed of garbage. It has been demonstrated
that such requirements not only are effective in reducing the
numbers of rats to the minimum, but also that they greatly improve
health conditions, reduce the fire hazard, and from a purely economic
standpoint are profitable. In one city in which rat proofing
has been vigorously prosecuted for a number of years and in which
more than 80 per cent of the old buildings have been made proof
against rats, the sharp decline in the number of fires resulted in
a 5 per cent reduction in the fire-insurance rates. More than
$1,000,000 was spent in the same city in rat proofing 10 miles of
docks, but even this large expenditure was found to be a profitable
investment.</p>

<p>Probably nothing so nearly reflects the sanitary conditions of a
city as the number of rats that it harbors, for the rat population is
usually in inverse ratio to the degree of sanitation maintained. In
1930 at least 13 cities in this country had rat-proofing laws, and more
than 30 others had fire-stopping requirements that are important in
rat proofing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">« 21 »</a></span></p>

<p>An effective rat-proofing program must be practicable and not
too drastic; otherwise it will fail from lack of popular support.
Attempts to enforce rat proofing of existing structures would probably
not be feasible unless under stress of an outbreak of bubonic
plague or other rat-borne disease epidemic. There seems to be no
good reason, however, why buildings constructed in the future or
remodeled should not be made rat proof under the requirements of
building ordinances. Had such ordinances been enacted 50 years
ago and rigidly enforced since that time the large majority of buildings
to-day would be rat proof, and rats, with their accompanying
filth and destructiveness, would have been largely eliminated. There
would also be fewer of the unsightly and insanitary shacks now
existing in most cities, and the average structure would be of a more
desirable type. As modern construction conforms so closely in principle
to the requirements of rat proofing, there should be little, if
any, opposition among builders to a rat-proofing clause in building
ordinances.</p>

<p>In considering the suppression of rats, at the outset city authorities
should discard all methods other than those that strike at the
source of the trouble. The actual destruction of rats is necessary
as a temporary means of stopping their depredations, but modern
construction and sanitation are the weapons that must be relied upon
to gain permanent relief. In addition to a rat-proofing ordinance,
every city should have a law requiring that all garbage wherever
accumulated be kept in rat-proof containers or garbage cans until
collected or until destroyed by incineration or otherwise disposed of
in a manner that would avoid the possibility of its providing food
for rats. Containers should have covers not easily removed by dogs
and other animals. The city should also enact regulations prohibiting
the accumulation of trash, refuse, or waste matter of any kind
on either public or private premises, and should provide adequate
means for collecting and disposing of all waste.</p>

<p>Consideration should also be given to the sewer system. Although
most modern sewers do not offer opportunity for the unrestricted
breeding of rats, there are many still in use that furnish harbors
for large numbers of these pests in sections of some cities. Of most
importance is the corner catch basin, storm sewer, or street-drainage
opening, which should be effectively remodeled, if necessary, to provide
smooth interior vertical walls with a drop of at least 3 feet;
rats are unable to jump 3 feet vertically or to climb smooth surfaces.</p>

<p>Another place that should receive attention is the city dumping
ground, which frequently serves as an incubator for rats, and these
soon overflow into near-by sections of the city. A study should be
made of methods of disposing of waste materials and a system put
into effect that will meet the requirements of the city and insure the
destruction, removal, or adequate covering of all such food for rats.
Any other conditions that may be found favorable for the breeding
of rats, whether on public or on private property, should be declared
a public nuisance and ordered corrected.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
